# AI-Java-Perf-Check

AI-Java-Perf-Check is an open-source toolkit designed to detect and highlight performance pitfalls commonly introduced by AI-generated Java code. In the AI-driven development era, developers increasingly rely on AI coding assistants â€” which may generate suboptimal or anti-pattern code impacting enterprise application performance.

## Why This Project

- Identify potential performance issues early in the development lifecycle.
- Prevent AI-generated code inefficiencies from reaching production.
- Assist developers and architects in writing optimal Java code for cloud-native environments.

## Features (Roadmap)

- Static analysis to detect common performance anti-patterns.
- Scoring system to highlight severity and priority.
- Recommendations for fixing identified issues.
- CI/CD integration support for enterprise environments.

## Getting Started

ðŸš§ The project is currently in active development. Stay tuned for the first release.
